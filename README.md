# Off The Coast

This mod aims to reinvent beaches, and add new tropical areas for the players to explore. Essentially a spiritual successor of Tropicraft (it is for fabric minecraft.) We aim to do this by adding a range of tropical islands, new sand variants, adding more exploration to Coral Reefs, and adding brand new sea and land mobs.

We aim to make the world feel more tropical and adventourous, while improving on regularly mediocre aspects of the game. 
From the creators of Dinocraft: Extinction.
